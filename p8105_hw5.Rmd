This homework flexes our skills on iteration and graphing. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### Problem 1: Case Control Study 

* The format of this problem involves the following: 
    + Importing the dataset
    + Tidying the dataset and creating a usable dataframe 
    + Creating a spaghetti plot 


### Problem 2: Crime in Large Cities 

* The format of this problem involves the following: 
    + Using the existing repo
    + Describing data 
    + Using functions to estimate crime rates
    + Creating plots with CIs


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
